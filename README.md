I've received a notice to cease and desist from Niantic Labs, and I've decided to shut down this project. It was my intention to augment and improve the game experience of Pokemon Go, and we did just that! Without their blessing, I don't see myself having the motivation to continue this project. This was a fun weekend project for a game I enjoyed, and now I’ve lost interest in both. Niantic’s actions towards 3rd party developers have been very off-putting and it has killed my personal motivation to work on this project. No need for a legal fund, they have no legal grounds to bully a broke college kid. I won’t resume development, but there are [active forks of this project](https://github.com/RocketMap/RocketMap) you could use.

This grew from a 2 hour weekend project to a community in a matter of days. The project got 6 million views, 44k clones, 160 contributors, translation into 10 languages, and a wonderful community all in the span of 2 weeks. It's also been featured on The Verge, Arstechnica, Lifehacker, Stern.de, Business Insider, and many others. It was truly a joy to see the hundreds of volunteers across the world hosting this project for their communities and coffee shops that hosted copies for their own customers! It's been my pleasure to get to know each of you guys: the core development team, the contributors, and the thousands that have gotten in touch with me! Stay in touch.
